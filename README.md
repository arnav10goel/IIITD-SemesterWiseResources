# IIITD-SemesterWiseResources

This repository includes academic resources for the courses at IIITD from Monsoon 2021 onwards. I have tried to include the various examination papers, assignments, tutorials, etc in the respective course folders whereas tried to list some video resources which I used myself in this README. I would highly recommend you all to also take a look at this amazing repo: [SemWiseResourcesIIIT-Aflah02](https://github.com/aflah02/SemWiseResourcesIIIT) for some more resources.

Note: You will find the solutions of most of the coding assignments on my GitHub itself in different repositories. Hope it helps you out :)
